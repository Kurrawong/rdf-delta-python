## RDF Patch Lark Parser

A Lark parser of the [RDF Patch](https://afs.github.io/rdf-delta/rdf-patch.html) format will be implemented soon.

This will allow for [Lark transformer and visitor](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/visitors.html) implementations to process and transform the abstract syntax tree as needed.
